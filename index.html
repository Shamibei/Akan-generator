Kradin,or in this case,Akan names , were  the first names usually given to a child immediately after birth.<br/>
The Akans beleive that this is the name which a person's soul offers them,since it is the soul of a person which decides when to let <br/>
the unborn child into this world...hence the term 'kradin' which directly translates to "soul names"<br/>
It was a common beleif among the Akans that the day of birth of a person would affect behaviour,fate and even the person's future.
